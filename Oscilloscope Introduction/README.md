# 🖥️ Oscilloscope and Triggering – Waveform Stability & External Triggers

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is focused on understanding and experimenting with the use of an **oscilloscope** for waveform observation and **triggering** using external signals.  
The main objective is to practice using **different trigger modes**, configure trigger sources (internal vs. external), and achieve a **stable display of waveforms** generated by function generators.

## 🔧 Key Components

### 1️⃣ Function Generator + Oscilloscope Setup
- Two function generators configured:
  - Channel 2: Triangle wave → Oscilloscope input
  - External trigger: Sine wave → Trigger input
- Objective: Use external triggering to **synchronize** display of waveform

---

### 2️⃣ Trigger Configuration
- Trigger mode: `Auto` initially
- Source: `External`
- Type: `Edge`
- Signals:
  - Triangle wave (CH2): with offset, frequency, and amplitude
  - Sine wave: used as trigger signal

---

### 3️⃣ Waveform Stability & Trigger Modes
- Observe waveform jitter vs. stability under:
  - Auto Trigger
  - Normal Trigger
- Adjust frequency and phase between CH2 and trigger input to observe effects
- Identify which settings lead to **stable** waveform

---

### 4️⃣ Trigger Level Exploration
- Trigger level voltage is varied:
  - 0V
  - Positive offset
  - Negative offset
- Observation: how trigger threshold affects:
  - Starting point of waveform
  - Visibility of rising/falling edges
  - Overall waveform alignment

---

### 5️⃣ Simulation & Analysis
- Use simulation software (LTSpice, Multisim, Proteus) to build full setup
- Record differences:
  - With/without external trigger
  - Auto vs. Normal mode
  - Varying trigger levels
- Capture screenshots for each setting

---
