# ⚡ Transient Response of Second-Order RC Circuits – Electrical Circuits Lab

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the **transient behavior** of **second-order RC circuits** under various damping conditions: **underdamped**, **critically damped**, and **overdamped**.  
The experiment includes theoretical calculations, hands-on measurements using an oscilloscope, and simulation-based validation of results.

## 🔧 Key Components

### 🛠 1. Circuit Setup
- An **RLC series** circuit is constructed using:
  - Resistor (variable)
  - Capacitor
  - Signal source: square wave
- A **potentiometer** is used to adjust resistance and induce different damping conditions

---

### 📉 2. Observed Damping Conditions
- **Underdamped**: Oscillatory decay
- **Critically damped**: Fastest response without oscillation
- **Overdamped**: Slow decay with no oscillations

Oscilloscope waveforms are captured for each case and analyzed accordingly.

### 📏 3. Critical Damping Analysis
- Calculate **critical resistance (R_critical)** theoretically  
- Measure real-world value using potentiometer and compare  
- Extract:
  - ⏱ Time constant (τ)
  - 🌀 Damping factor (ζ)  
- Compare measured vs. theoretical values

---

### 💻 4. Simulation and Validation
- Circuit simulated using software (e.g., **LTSpice**, **Multisim**, **Proteus**)
- Compare:
  - Simulation vs. experimental waveforms
  - Phase shift and frequency response curves
- Visual confirmation of damping accuracy
