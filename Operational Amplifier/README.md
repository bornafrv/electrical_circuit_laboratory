# ⚙️ Operational Amplifier Circuits – Inverting, Summing, and Buffer Amplifiers

## 📌 Project Overview
This project investigates the design, simulation, and analysis of basic **Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp)** circuits. The objective is to build and understand circuits such as **inverting amplifiers**, **summing amplifiers**, and **buffer circuits**, and to evaluate their behavior both theoretically and practically using simulation tools.

## 🔧 Key Components

### 1️⃣ Inverting Amplifier
- Configuration: Standard inverting op-amp setup
- Key relation: V_out = - (R_f / R_in) * V_in
- Procedure:
  - Set input voltage and resistor values
  - Simulate and measure output
  - Compare with theoretical gain

---

### 2️⃣ Summing Amplifier
- Multiple inputs connected through resistors to the inverting terminal
- Output is weighted sum:  
  V_out = - (R_f) * (V1/R1 + V2/R2 + ...)
- Aim: Demonstrate analog addition
- Optimization: Tune resistor ratios to control weights

### 3️⃣ Buffer Circuit (Voltage Follower)
- Configuration: Output connected directly to inverting input
- Purpose: Prevent loading effects and maintain voltage levels
- Test: Compare load behavior with and without buffer in the system
