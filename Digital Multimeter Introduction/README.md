# 🔌 Multimeter Analysis: Internal Resistance & Voltage Measurements

## 📘 Project Overview
This project explores the use of **digital multimeters** to measure **internal resistance** and **voltage** in various circuit configurations. The objective is to evaluate how multimeter characteristics affect measurement accuracy and to calculate the minimum internal resistance required for acceptable precision.

## 🧩 Key Components

### 1️⃣ Measuring Voltmeter Internal Resistance
- A voltmeter is connected **in parallel** with a circuit branch.
- Voltage readings are taken to estimate the **internal resistance** of the voltmeter.
- Theoretical analysis explains how low internal resistance skews voltage readings.

---

### 2️⃣ Dual Multimeter Configuration
- Two digital multimeters are connected:
  - One in **voltage mode**
  - The other in **resistance (ohmmeter) mode**
- The goal is to compare measured vs. calculated internal resistance values.
- Different configurations help visualize how current paths affect accuracy.

### 3️⃣ Simulating Voltage Measurement Error
- A multimeter is virtually connected in **parallel with resistor R8**.
- Simulations and formulas are used to estimate the **minimum internal resistance** needed to keep **measurement error below 5%**.
- Comparisons between **theoretical vs. simulation results** provide validation.
