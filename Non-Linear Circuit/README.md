# 🔀 Non-Linear Circuits with Diodes

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the behavior of **non-linear resistive circuits** using diodes. The goal is to simulate and analyze how non-linear components influence the voltage-current (V-I) characteristics of a circuit and how different diode types (regular, Zener) change circuit response.

## ⚙️ Key Components

### 1️⃣ Diode-Based Non-Linear Circuit
- A resistive circuit is designed with diodes.
- Simulations yield **V-I characteristics** for both positive and negative input voltages.
- Resistance (slope of V-I curve) is evaluated in different regions.

---

### 2️⃣ V-I Curve Breakpoints
- Breakpoints in the curve indicate transitions such as:
  - Diode turn-on voltage
  - Zener breakdown voltage
- Effects of adding a voltage source are also observed.

---

### 3️⃣ Simulation & Load Line Analysis
- Circuit simulated in **Multisim** or equivalent tool.
- Voltage and current across nodes are measured.
- A **load line** is plotted to find the **operating point**, and its intersection with the V-I curve is analyzed.

---

### 4️⃣ Comparison with Theoretical Results
- Simulated data is compared with hand-calculated V-I curves.
- Comparison between:
  - Regular vs. Zener diodes
  - Expected vs. measured operating points
- Differences in response due to diode non-linearity are highlighted.
